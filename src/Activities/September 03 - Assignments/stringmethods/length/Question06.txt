Question 6: Hidden Lengths

Task:
Create a string that includes leading and trailing spaces, such as " Java ". Without removing the spaces, use the length() method to determine the length of the string. Then, explain how the length changes if the spaces are removed from the start and end of the string.

Expected Outcome:
Students should observe that spaces count towards the total length and compare the results with the length of the trimmed string.
