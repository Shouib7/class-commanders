    Arrays

    Real-life Example:

    Imagine you have a bookshelf in your room. This bookshelf has a specific number of slots where
    you can place books. Each slot holds exactly one book. If you want to refer to a book,
    you know its position on the shelf, like the third book from the left or the fifth book from the right.
    An array works similarly.

    Programming Explanation:

    In programming, an array is a data structure that can hold more than one value at a time.
    It is a collection of variables that are accessed with an index number.
    All items in an array are of the same data type and each has a unique index,
    starting from 0 (similar to the slot number in our bookshelf example).

    Java Implementation:

    There are mainly two ways to initialize an array:

    Static Initialization: Here, you specify the size of the array and initialize
    it with values at the same time.


    int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};


    Dynamic Initialization: In this method, you specify the size of the array first, and then you
    can set values using the index.

    int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Declare an array of size 5
    numbers[0] = 10;  // The first element
    numbers[1] = 20;  // The second element
// ... and so on.
