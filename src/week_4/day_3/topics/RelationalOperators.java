  /*  Imagine you're lining up books on a shelf based on their heights.
  You will need to compare the heights of these books to decide their positions:
  which book is taller, which one is shorter, and which ones are of equal height.


    Java-related explanation:

    Relational operators are used in Java to compare two values and establish a relationship between
    them:

    > (Greater Than): Checks if the value on the left is greater than the one on the right.
    < (Less Than): Checks if the value on the left is less than the one on the right.
    >= (Greater Than or Equal To): Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the one on the right.
    <= (Less Than or Equal To): Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the one on the right.
